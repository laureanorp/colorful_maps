# Minimal maps

#### Get a minimal and colorful map of a given location Â· Flask + Nominatim + Google Maps

After trying some geocoders and APIs, I decided wanted to experiment a bit with Google Maps' API. This Flask app takes a location as input, as well as a color palette, and returns a minimalistic map of the location to see/download.

Future improvements I want to do:
- More palettes/custom palettes support
- Better responsive design

## Running the project

1. Clone/download repo
2. Create a venv (recommended, but there are only 3 required dependencies)
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Insert your Google Maps API key in `app.py`
5. Run `python app.py`
6. Open http://localhost:5000/
